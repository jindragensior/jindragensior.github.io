I enjoy being able to talk about all things astrophysics, whether that is in the context of [teaching](#teaching) in lectures, mentoring students or participating in outreach events. I have been a speaker at a few events, e.g. at the Big Bang Bash of the Edinburgh International Science Festival in 2016, or for the [Mimikry: Exomoon](https://seads.network/project/exomoon) immersive play at the Theater am Neumarkt in Zurich in 2023. Additionally, I have been an interviewee for school students working on galaxy-related projects in the canton of Zurich. 

One aspect I particularly enjoy about outreach is coming up with memorable and engaging ways to convey the material in accessible ways. As such I have written a couple of [dances](#dances) and [poems](#poems) about star formation, astrochemistry, galaxy formation and evolution. Please [get in touch](/#contact) if you are interested in me giving a talk/writing a dance/poem for your event.

Many complex astrophysical processes can be broken down into a combination geometrical patterns and simple movements, aka dances. 

I have collaborated with [Science Ceilidh](https://www.scienceceilidh.com), who do a fantastic job of writing Ceilidh dances about all sorts of STEM subjects, to write [Stardust](/blog/stardust), a Ceilidh dance about the lifecycle of stars. 

I also wrote [Dustborne](/blog/dustborne), a rather complicated Scottish country dance medley, about star formation and primordial astrochemistry and am working on a Highland dance about radiative transfer processes in the interstellar medium.

I have written [Song of the Galaxies](/blog/song-of-the-galaxies) as a short summary of the contents of my galaxy formation and evolution lectures. It is a rewrite of Shakespeare's famous [Song of the Witches](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43189/song-of-the-witches-double-double-toil-and-trouble) from Macbeth, with the analogy of galaxies as cosmic cauldrons.

[We're all made of stardust](/blog/were-all-made-of-stardust) was written in the context of the lecture performance for [Mimikry: Exomoon](https://seads.network/project/exomoon), with the aim to both convey information about the lifecyle of interstellar gas and nucleosynthesis, in addition to inviting reflection about the question at the core of the play: _who will we become if given the chance to start a new life on a space settlement far, far away from Earth?_
