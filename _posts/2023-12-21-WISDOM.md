## WISDOM Project - XVI. The link between circumnuclear molecular gas reservoirs and active galactic nucleus fuelling ##
We use high-resolution data from the millimetre-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses (WISDOM) project to investigate the connection between circumnuclear gas reservoirs and nuclear activity in a sample of nearby galaxies. Our sample spans a wide range of nuclear activity types including radio galaxies, Seyfert galaxies, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) and inactive galaxies. We use measurements of nuclear millimetre continuum emission along with other archival tracers of AGN accretion/activity to investigate previous claims that at, circumnuclear scales (<100 pc), these should correlate with the mass of the cold molecular gas. We find that the molecular gas mass does not correlate with any tracer of nuclear activity. This suggests the level of nuclear activity cannot solely be regulated by the amount of cold gas around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This indicates that AGN fuelling, that drives gas from the large scale galaxy to the nuclear regions, is not a ubiquitous process and may vary between AGN type, with timescale variations likely to be very important. By studying the structure of the central molecular gas reservoirs, we find our galaxies have a range of nuclear molecular gas concentrations. This could indicate that some of our galaxies may have had their circumnuclear regions impacted by AGN feedback, even though they currently have low nuclear activity. On the other hand, the nuclear molecular gas concentrations in our galaxies could instead be set by secular processes.

## A fundamental plane of black hole accretion at millimetre wavelengths ##
We report the discovery of the ``mm fundamental plane of black-hole accretion'', which is a tight correlation between the nuclear 1 mm luminosity (L<sub>ν,mm</sub>), the 2 -- 10~keV X-ray luminosity (L<sub>X,2−10</sub>) and the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass (MBH) with an intrinsic scatter (σ<sub>int</sub>) of 0.40 dex. The plane is found for a sample of 48 nearby galaxies, most of which are radiatively-inefficient, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN). Combining these sources with a sample of high-luminosity (quasar-like) nearby AGN, we find that the plane still holds. We also find that MBH correlates with Lν,mm at a highly significant level, although such correlation is less tight than the mm fundamental plane (σ<sub>int</sub>=0.51 dex). Crucially, we show that spectral energy distribution (SED) models for both advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) and compact jets can explain the existence of these relations, which are not reproduced by the standard torus-thin accretion disc models usually associated to quasar-like AGN. The ADAF models reproduces the observed relations somewhat better than those for compact jets, although neither provides a perfect prediction. Our findings thus suggest that radiatively-inefficient accretion processes such as those in ADAFs or compact (and thus likely young) jets may play a key role in both low- and high-luminosity AGN. This mm fundamental plane also offers a new, rapid method to (indirectly) estimate SMBH masses.

## WISDOM Project - XVII. Beam-by-beam properties of the molecular gas in early-type galaxies  ##
We present a study of the molecular gas of seven early-type galaxies with high angular resolution data obtained as part of the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses (WISDOM) project with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Using a fixed spatial-scale approach, we study the mass surface density (Σ) and velocity dispersion (σ) of the molecular gas on spatial scales ranging from 60 to 120 pc. Given the spatial resolution of our data (20-70 pc), we characterize these properties across many thousands of individual sightlines (≈50 000 at our highest physical resolution). The molecular gas along these sightlines has a large range (≈2 dex) of mass surface densities and velocity dispersions ≈40  per cent higher than those of star-forming spiral galaxies. It has virial parameters α<sub>vir</sub> that depend weakly on the physical scale observed, likely due to beam smearing of the bulk galactic rotation, and is generally supervirial. Comparing the internal turbulent pressure (P<sub>turb</sub>) to the pressure required for dynamic equilibrium (P<sub>DE</sub>), the ratio P<sub>turb</sub>/P<sub>DE</sub> is significantly less than unity in all galaxies, indicating that the gas is not in dynamic equilibrium and is strongly compressed, in apparent contradiction to the virial parameters. This may be due to our neglect of shear and tidal forces, and/or the combination of three-dimensional and vertical diagnostics. Both α<sub>vir</sub> and P<sub>turb</sub> anticorrelate with the global star-formation rate of our galaxies. We therefore conclude that the molecular gas in early-type galaxies is likely unbound, and that large-scale dynamics likely plays a critical role in its regulation. This contrasts to the giant molecular clouds in the discs of late-type galaxies, that are much closer to dynamical equilibrium.

## WISDOM Project - XV. Giant molecular clouds in the central region of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 5806  ##

We present high spatial resolution (≈24 pc) Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array <sup>12</sup>CO(2-1) observations of the central region of the nearby barred spiral galaxy NGC 5806. NGC 5806 has a highly structured molecular gas distribution with a clear nucleus, a nuclear ring, and offset dust lanes. We identify 170 spatially and spectrally resolved giant molecular clouds (GMCs). These clouds have comparable sizes (R<sub>c</sub>) and larger gas masses, observed linewidths (σ<sub>obs, los</sub>), and gas mass surface densities than those of clouds in the Milky Way disc. The size-linewidth relation of the clouds is one of the steepest reported so far (σ<sub>obs,los</sub>∝R<sub>c</sub><sup>1.20</sup>), the clouds are on average only marginally bound (with a mean virial parameter ⟨α<sub>vir</sub>⟩ ≈ 2), and high velocity dispersions are observed in the nuclear ring. These behaviours are likely due to bar-driven gas shocks and inflows along the offset dust lanes, and we infer an inflow velocity of ≈120 kms<sup>-1</sup> and a total molecular gas mass inflow rate of ≈5 M<sub>⊙</sub>yr<sup>-1</sup> into the nuclear ring. The observed internal velocity gradients of the clouds are consistent with internal turbulence. The number of clouds in the nuclear ring decreases with azimuthal angle downstream from the dust lanes without clear variation of cloud properties. This is likely due to the estimated short lifetime of the clouds (≈6 Myr), which appears to be mainly regulated by cloud-cloud collision and/or shear processes. Overall, it thus seems that the presence of the large-scale bar and gas inflows to the centre of NGC 5806 affect cloud properties.

## WISDOM project - XI. Star formation efficiency in the bulge of the AGN-host Galaxy NGC 3169 with SITELLE and ALMA  ##
The star formation efficiency (SFE) has been shown to vary across different environments, particularly within galactic starbursts and deep within the bulges of galaxies. Various quenching mechanisms may be responsible, ranging from galactic dynamics to feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here, we use spatially resolved observations of warm ionized gas emission lines (Hβ, [O III] λλ4959,5007, [N II] λλ6548,6583, Hα and [S II] λλ6716,6731) from the imaging Fourier transform spectrograph SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and cold molecular gas (<sup>12</sup>CO(2-1)) from the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to study the SFE in the bulge of the AGN-host galaxy NGC 3169. After distinguishing star-forming regions from AGN-ionized regions using emission-line ratio diagnostics, we measure spatially resolved molecular gas depletion times (τ<sub>dep</sub> ≡1/SFE) with a spatial resolution of ≈100 pc within a galactocentric radius of 1.8 kpc. We identify a star-forming ring located at radii 1.25 ± 0.6 kpc with an average τ<sub>dep</sub> of 0.3 Gyr. At radii <0.9 kpc, however, the molecular gas surface densities and depletion times increase with decreasing radius, the latter reaching approximately 2.3 Gyr at a radius ≈500 pc. Based on analyses of the gas kinematics and comparisons with simulations, we identify AGN feedback, bulge morphology and dynamics as the possible causes of the radial profile of SFE observed in the central region of NGC 3169.
