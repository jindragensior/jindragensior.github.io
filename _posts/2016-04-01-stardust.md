I collaborated with the fantastic [Science Ceilidh](https://www.scienceceilidh.com) to write a Ceilidh dance that describes the life-cyle of stars from the formation out of giant molecular clouds in the interstellar medium to their deaths and recycling of material to form the next generation of stars. 

[Star Dust](https://www.scienceceilidh.com/stardust) is a simple dance that can be danced by dancers of all abilities, though I would recommend replacing the polka by promenading round the room, if the majority of people are unfamiliar with it. See below for the full cribs and a gorgeous animation that Science Ceilidh created based on our performance at the Edinburgh International Science festival in 2016.
