description: "Here, we use the 1D radial power spectrum of the gas mass surface density to constrain the structure in the Heart of Darkness simulated galaxies and observed ETGs and LTGs from the WISDOM project. For the simulated galaxies the power spectrum slope correlates with the central stellar surface density (potential well depth), for the observed galaxies it does not. Accepted by MNRAS."

### Abstract ### 
Observations indicate that the central gas discs are smoother in early-type galaxies than their late-type counterparts, while recent simulations predict that the dynamical suppression of star formation in spheroid-dominated galaxies is preceded by the suppression of fragmentation of their interstellar media. The mass surface density power spectrum is a powerful tool to constrain the degree of structure within a gas reservoir. Specifically here, we focus on the power spectrum slope and aim to constrain whether the shear induced by a dominant spheroidal potential can induce sufficient turbulence to suppress fragmentation, resulting in the smooth central gas discs observed. We compute surface density power spectra for the nuclear gas reservoirs of fourteen simulated isolated galaxies and twelve galaxies observed as part of the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses (WISDOM) project. Both simulated and observed galaxies range from disc-dominated galaxies to spheroids, with central stellar mass surface densities, a measure of bulge dominance, varying by more than an order of magnitude. For the simulations, the power spectra steepen with increasing central stellar mass surface density, thereby clearly linking the suppression of fragmentation to the shear-driven turbulence induced by the spheroid. The WISDOM observations show a different (but potentially consistent) picture: while there is no correlation between the power spectrum slopes and the central stellar mass surface densities, the slopes scatter around a value of 2.6. This is similar to the behaviour of the slopes of the simulated galaxies with high central stellar mass surface densities, and could indicate that high shear eventually drives incompressible turbulence.
