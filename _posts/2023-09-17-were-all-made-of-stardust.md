The brief for the lecture performances was to give a short performance about astrophysics, space science or space exploration that could be entirely scientific but was welcome to be speculative, philosophical, futuristic and outside the box. So I wrote the poem below to try and balance the scientific with the question(s) asked by [Mimikry:Exomoon](https://seads.network/project/exomoon) - _who will we [humanity] become if given the chance to start a new life on a space settlement far, far away from Earth?_

The images in the post header are the famous [Pillars of Creation](https://www.nasa.gov/universe/nasas-webb-takes-star-filled-portrait-of-pillars-of-creation/), a star-forming region in the Eagle nebula a few thousand lightyears away from us. They were imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST; left panel) and the JWST (right panel). Since JWST observes at longer (near-infrared) wavelengths, compared to the HST (optical), the dust is less opaque and more stars embedded in their natal gas and dust clouds and in the galactic background can be seen. *Image credits: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI; Joseph DePasquale (STScI), Anton M.
