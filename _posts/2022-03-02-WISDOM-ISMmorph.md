description: "We compare the morphology of the central molecular gas discs of early- and late-type galaxies in observations and simulations using non-parametric indicators (Gini, S, A). The gas in ETGs is smoother and more symmetric than in LTGs, which correlates with the depth of the gravitational potential. Accepted by MNRAS."

### Abstract ### 
We use high-resolution maps of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) in the centres of
eighty-six nearby galaxies from the millimetre-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object
Masses (WISDOM) and Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS)
surveys to investigate the physical mechanisms setting the morphology of the ISM at molecular
cloud scales. We show that early-type galaxies tend to have smooth, regular molecular gas
morphologies, while the ISM in spiral galaxy bulges is much more asymmetric and clumpy
when observed at the same spatial scales. We quantify these differences using non-parametric
morphology measures (Asymmetry, Smoothness and Gini), and compare these measurements
with those extracted from idealised galaxy simulations. We show that the morphology of the
molecular ISM changes systematically as a function of various large scale galaxy parameters,
including galaxy morphological type, stellar mass, stellar velocity dispersion, effective stellar
mass surface density, molecular gas surface density, star formation efficiency and the presence
of a bar. We perform a statistical analysis to determine which of these correlated parameters
best predicts the morphology of the ISM. We find the effective stellar mass surface (or
volume) density to be the strongest predictor of the morphology of the molecular gas, while
star formation and bars maybe be important secondary drivers. We find that gas self-gravity
is not the dominant process shaping the morphology of the molecular gas in galaxy centres.
Instead effects caused by the depth of the potential well such as shear, suppression of stellar
spiral density waves and/or inflow affect the ability of the gas to fragment.
