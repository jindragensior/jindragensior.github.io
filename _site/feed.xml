<h2 id="wisdom-project---xvi-the-link-between-circumnuclear-molecular-gas-reservoirs-and-active-galactic-nucleus-fuelling">WISDOM Project - XVI. The link between circumnuclear molecular gas reservoirs and active galactic nucleus fuelling</h2>
<p>We use high-resolution data from the millimetre-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses (WISDOM) project to investigate the connection between circumnuclear gas reservoirs and nuclear activity in a sample of nearby galaxies. Our sample spans a wide range of nuclear activity types including radio galaxies, Seyfert galaxies, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) and inactive galaxies. We use measurements of nuclear millimetre continuum emission along with other archival tracers of AGN accretion/activity to investigate previous claims that at, circumnuclear scales (&lt;100 pc), these should correlate with the mass of the cold molecular gas. We find that the molecular gas mass does not correlate with any tracer of nuclear activity. This suggests the level of nuclear activity cannot solely be regulated by the amount of cold gas around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). This indicates that AGN fuelling, that drives gas from the large scale galaxy to the nuclear regions, is not a ubiquitous process and may vary between AGN type, with timescale variations likely to be very important. By studying the structure of the central molecular gas reservoirs, we find our galaxies have a range of nuclear molecular gas concentrations. This could indicate that some of our galaxies may have had their circumnuclear regions impacted by AGN feedback, even though they currently have low nuclear activity. On the other hand, the nuclear molecular gas concentrations in our galaxies could instead be set by secular processes.</p>

<h2 id="a-fundamental-plane-of-black-hole-accretion-at-millimetre-wavelengths">A fundamental plane of black hole accretion at millimetre wavelengths</h2>
<p>We report the discovery of the ``mm fundamental plane of black-hole accretion’’, which is a tight correlation between the nuclear 1 mm luminosity (L<sub>ν,mm</sub>), the 2 – 10~keV X-ray luminosity (L<sub>X,2−10</sub>) and the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass (MBH) with an intrinsic scatter (σ<sub>int</sub>) of 0.40 dex. The plane is found for a sample of 48 nearby galaxies, most of which are radiatively-inefficient, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN). Combining these sources with a sample of high-luminosity (quasar-like) nearby AGN, we find that the plane still holds. We also find that MBH correlates with Lν,mm at a highly significant level, although such correlation is less tight than the mm fundamental plane (σ<sub>int</sub>=0.51 dex). Crucially, we show that spectral energy distribution (SED) models for both advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) and compact jets can explain the existence of these relations, which are not reproduced by the standard torus-thin accretion disc models usually associated to quasar-like AGN. The ADAF models reproduces the observed relations somewhat better than those for compact jets, although neither provides a perfect prediction. Our findings thus suggest that radiatively-inefficient accretion processes such as those in ADAFs or compact (and thus likely young) jets may play a key role in both low- and high-luminosity AGN. This mm fundamental plane also offers a new, rapid method to (indirectly) estimate SMBH masses.</p>

<h2 id="wisdom-project---xvii-beam-by-beam-properties-of-the-molecular-gas-in-early-type-galaxies">WISDOM Project - XVII. Beam-by-beam properties of the molecular gas in early-type galaxies</h2>
<p>We present a study of the molecular gas of seven early-type galaxies with high angular resolution data obtained as part of the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses (WISDOM) project with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. Using a fixed spatial-scale approach, we study the mass surface density (Σ) and velocity dispersion (σ) of the molecular gas on spatial scales ranging from 60 to 120 pc. Given the spatial resolution of our data (20-70 pc), we characterize these properties across many thousands of individual sightlines (≈50 000 at our highest physical resolution). The molecular gas along these sightlines has a large range (≈2 dex) of mass surface densities and velocity dispersions ≈40  per cent higher than those of star-forming spiral galaxies. It has virial parameters α<sub>vir</sub> that depend weakly on the physical scale observed, likely due to beam smearing of the bulk galactic rotation, and is generally supervirial. Comparing the internal turbulent pressure (P<sub>turb</sub>) to the pressure required for dynamic equilibrium (P<sub>DE</sub>), the ratio P<sub>turb</sub>/P<sub>DE</sub> is significantly less than unity in all galaxies, indicating that the gas is not in dynamic equilibrium and is strongly compressed, in apparent contradiction to the virial parameters. This may be due to our neglect of shear and tidal forces, and/or the combination of three-dimensional and vertical diagnostics. Both α<sub>vir</sub> and P<sub>turb</sub> anticorrelate with the global star-formation rate of our galaxies. We therefore conclude that the molecular gas in early-type galaxies is likely unbound, and that large-scale dynamics likely plays a critical role in its regulation. This contrasts to the giant molecular clouds in the discs of late-type galaxies, that are much closer to dynamical equilibrium.</p>

<p>We present high spatial resolution (≈24 pc) Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array <sup>12</sup>CO(2-1) observations of the central region of the nearby barred spiral galaxy NGC 5806. NGC 5806 has a highly structured molecular gas distribution with a clear nucleus, a nuclear ring, and offset dust lanes. We identify 170 spatially and spectrally resolved giant molecular clouds (GMCs). These clouds have comparable sizes (R<sub>c</sub>) and larger gas masses, observed linewidths (σ<sub>obs, los</sub>), and gas mass surface densities than those of clouds in the Milky Way disc. The size-linewidth relation of the clouds is one of the steepest reported so far (σ<sub>obs,los</sub>∝R<sub>c</sub><sup>1.20</sup>), the clouds are on average only marginally bound (with a mean virial parameter ⟨α<sub>vir</sub>⟩ ≈ 2), and high velocity dispersions are observed in the nuclear ring. These behaviours are likely due to bar-driven gas shocks and inflows along the offset dust lanes, and we infer an inflow velocity of ≈120 kms<sup>-1</sup> and a total molecular gas mass inflow rate of ≈5 M<sub>⊙</sub>yr<sup>-1</sup> into the nuclear ring. The observed internal velocity gradients of the clouds are consistent with internal turbulence. The number of clouds in the nuclear ring decreases with azimuthal angle downstream from the dust lanes without clear variation of cloud properties. This is likely due to the estimated short lifetime of the clouds (≈6 Myr), which appears to be mainly regulated by cloud-cloud collision and/or shear processes. Overall, it thus seems that the presence of the large-scale bar and gas inflows to the centre of NGC 5806 affect cloud properties.</p>

<p>The star formation efficiency (SFE) has been shown to vary across different environments, particularly within galactic starbursts and deep within the bulges of galaxies. Various quenching mechanisms may be responsible, ranging from galactic dynamics to feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here, we use spatially resolved observations of warm ionized gas emission lines (Hβ, [O III] λλ4959,5007, [N II] λλ6548,6583, Hα and [S II] λλ6716,6731) from the imaging Fourier transform spectrograph SITELLE at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and cold molecular gas (<sup>12</sup>CO(2-1)) from the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to study the SFE in the bulge of the AGN-host galaxy NGC 3169. After distinguishing star-forming regions from AGN-ionized regions using emission-line ratio diagnostics, we measure spatially resolved molecular gas depletion times (τ<sub>dep</sub> ≡1/SFE) with a spatial resolution of ≈100 pc within a galactocentric radius of 1.8 kpc. We identify a star-forming ring located at radii 1.25 ± 0.6 kpc with an average τ<sub>dep</sub> of 0.3 Gyr. At radii &lt;0.9 kpc, however, the molecular gas surface densities and depletion times increase with decreasing radius, the latter reaching approximately 2.3 Gyr at a radius ≈500 pc. Based on analyses of the gas kinematics and comparisons with simulations, we identify AGN feedback, bulge morphology and dynamics as the possible causes of the radial profile of SFE observed in the central region of NGC 3169.</p>

<h2 id="starburst-induced-gas-stars-kinematic-misalignment">Starburst-induced gas-stars kinematic misalignment</h2>

<p>A kinematic misalignment of the stellar and gas components is a phenomenon observed in a significant fraction of galaxies. However, the underlying physical mechanisms are not well understood. A commonly proposed scenario for the formation of a misaligned component requires any pre-existing gas disc to be removed, via fly-bys or ejective feedback from an active galactic nucleus. In this Letter, we study the evolution of a Milky Way mass galaxy in the FIREbox cosmological volume that displays a thin, counter-rotating gas disc with respect to its stellar component at low redshift. In contrast to scenarios involving gas ejection, we find that pre-existing gas is mainly removed via the conversion into stars in a central starburst, triggered by a merging satellite galaxy. The newly-accreted, counter-rotating gas eventually settles into a kinematically misaligned disc. About 4.4 (8 out of 182) of FIREbox galaxies with stellar masses larger than 5e9 Msun at z=0 exhibit gas-star kinematic misalignment. In all cases, we identify central starburst-driven depletion as the main reason for the removal of the pre-existing co-rotating gas component, with no need for feedback from, e.g., a central active black hole. However, during the starburst, the gas is funneled towards the central regions, likely enhancing black hole activity. By comparing the fraction of misaligned discs between FIREbox and other simulations and observations, we conclude that this channel might have a non-negligible role in inducing kinematic misalignment in galaxies.</p>

<h2 id="starbursts-driven-by-central-gas-compaction">Starbursts driven by central gas compaction</h2>
<p>Starburst (SB) galaxies are a rare population of galaxies with star formation rates (SFRs) greatly exceeding those of the majority of star-forming galaxies with similar stellar mass. It is unclear whether these bursts are the result of either especially large gas reservoirs or enhanced efficiencies in converting gas into stars. Tidal torques resulting from gas-rich galaxy mergers are known to enhance the SFR by funneling gas towards the centre. However, recent theoretical works show that mergers do not always trigger a SB and not all SB galaxies are interacting systems, raising the question of what drives a SB. We analyse a large sample of SB galaxies and a mass- and redshift-matched sample of control galaxies, drawn from the FIREbox cosmological volume at z=0-1. We find that SB galaxies have both larger molecular gas fractions and shorter molecular depletion times than control galaxies, but similar total gas masses. Control galaxies evolve towards the SB regime by gas compaction in their central regions, over timescales of about 70 Myr, accompanied by an increase in the fraction of ultra-dense and molecular gas. The driving mechanism behind the SB varies depending on the mass of the galaxy. Massive (M∗ &gt; 10<sup>10</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>) galaxies undergoing intense, long-lasting SBs are mostly driven by galaxy interactions. Conversely, SBs in non-interacting galaxies are often triggered by a global gravitational instability, that can result in a breathing mode in low-mass galaxies.</p>

<h2 id="the-inefficiency-of-stellar-feedback-in-driving-galactic-outflows-in-massive-galaxies-at-high-redshift">The inefficiency of stellar feedback in driving galactic outflows in massive galaxies at high redshift</h2>
<p>Recent observations indicate that galactic outflows are ubiquitous in high-redshift (high-z) galaxies, including normal star-forming galaxies, quasar hosts, and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). However, the impact of outflows on the evolution of their hosts is still an open question. Here, we analyse the star-formation histories and galactic outflow properties of galaxies in massive haloes (10<sup>12</sup>M<sub>⊙</sub> &lt; M<sub>vir</sub> &lt; 5×10<sup>12</sup>M<sub>⊙</sub>) at z ≳ 5.5 in three zoom-in cosmological simulations from the MassiveFIRE suite, as part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. The simulations were run with the FIRE-2 model, which does not include feedback from active galactic nuclei. The simulated galaxies resemble z &gt; 4 DSFGs, with star-formation rates of ∼1000 M<sub>⊙</sub>yr<sup>−1</sup> and molecular gas masses of M<sub>mol</sub> ~ 10<sup>10</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>. However, the simulated galaxies are characterized by higher circular velocities than those observed in high-z DSFGs. The mass loading factors from stellar feedback are of the order of ~0.1, implying that stellar feedback is inefficient in driving galactic outflows and gas is consumed by star formation on much shorter time-scales than it is expelled from the interstellar medium. We also find that stellar feedback is highly inefficient in self-regulating star formation in this regime, with an average integrated star formation efficiency (SFE) per dynamical time of 30 per cent. Finally, compared with FIRE-2 galaxies hosted in similarly massive haloes at lower redshift, we find lower mass loading factors and higher SFEs in the high-z sample. We argue that both effects originate from the higher total and gas surface densities that characterize high-z massive systems.</p>

<h2 id="firebox-simulating-galaxies-at-high-dynamic-range-in-a-cosmological-volume">FIREbox: simulating galaxies at high dynamic range in a cosmological volume</h2>
<p>We introduce a suite of cosmological volume simulations to study the evolution of galaxies as part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. FIREbox, the principal simulation of the present suite, provides a representative sample of galaxies (~1000 galaxies with M∗ &gt; 10<sup>8</sup>M<sub>⊙</sub> at z = 0) at a resolution (Δx∼20pc , m<sub>b</sub>∼6×10<sup>4</sup>M<sub>⊙</sub> ) comparable to state-of-the-art galaxy zoom-in simulations. FIREbox captures the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium in a fully cosmological setting (L = 22.1 Mpc) thanks to its exceptionally high dynamic range (≳10<sup>6</sup>) and the inclusion of multichannel stellar feedback. Here, we focus on validating the simulation predictions by comparing to observational data. We find that star formation rates, gas masses, and metallicities of simulated galaxies with M∗ &lt; 10<sup>10.5−11</sup>M<sub>⊙</sub> broadly agree with observations. These galaxy scaling relations extend to low masses (M∗∼10<sup>7</sup>M<sub>⊙</sub>) and follow a (broken) power-law relationship. Also reproduced are the evolution of the cosmic HI density and the HI column density distribution at z ~ 0-5. At low z, FIREbox predicts a peak in the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation but also a higher abundance of massive galaxies and a higher cosmic star formation rate density than observed, showing that stellar feedback alone is insufficient to reproduce the properties of massive galaxies at late times. Given its high resolution and sample size, FIREbox offers a baseline prediction of galaxy formation theory in a ΛCDM Universe while also highlighting modelling challenges to be addressed in next-generation galaxy simulations.</p>

<p>Observations indicate that the central gas discs are smoother in early-type galaxies than their late-type counterparts, while recent simulations predict that the dynamical suppression of star formation in spheroid-dominated galaxies is preceded by the suppression of fragmentation of their interstellar media. The mass surface density power spectrum is a powerful tool to constrain the degree of structure within a gas reservoir. Specifically here, we focus on the power spectrum slope and aim to constrain whether the shear induced by a dominant spheroidal potential can induce sufficient turbulence to suppress fragmentation, resulting in the smooth central gas discs observed. We compute surface density power spectra for the nuclear gas reservoirs of fourteen simulated isolated galaxies and twelve galaxies observed as part of the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses (WISDOM) project. Both simulated and observed galaxies range from disc-dominated galaxies to spheroids, with central stellar mass surface densities, a measure of bulge dominance, varying by more than an order of magnitude. For the simulations, the power spectra steepen with increasing central stellar mass surface density, thereby clearly linking the suppression of fragmentation to the shear-driven turbulence induced by the spheroid. The WISDOM observations show a different (but potentially consistent) picture: while there is no correlation between the power spectrum slopes and the central stellar mass surface densities, the slopes scatter around a value of 2.6. This is similar to the behaviour of the slopes of the simulated galaxies with high central stellar mass surface densities, and could indicate that high shear eventually drives incompressible turbulence.</p>

<p>Understanding what shapes the cold gas component of galaxies, which both provides the fuel for star formation and is strongly affected by the subsequent stellar feedback, is a crucial step towards a better understanding of galaxy evolution. Here, we analyse the HI properties of a sample of 46 Milky Way halo-mass galaxies, drawn from cosmological simulations (EMP-Pathfinder and Firebox). This set of simulations comprises galaxies evolved self-consistently across cosmic time with different baryonic sub-grid physics: three different star formation models [constant star formation efficiency (SFE) with different star formation eligibility criteria, and an environmentally-dependent, turbulence-based SFE] and two different feedback prescriptions, where only one sub-sample includes early stellar feedback. We use these simulations to assess the impact of different baryonic physics on the HI content of galaxies. We find that the galaxy-wide HI properties agree with each other and with observations. However, differences appear for small-scale properties. The thin HI discs observed in the local Universe are only reproduced with a turbulence-dependent SFE and/or early stellar feedback. Furthermore, we find that the morphology of HI discs is particularly sensitive to the different physics models: galaxies simulated with a turbulence-based SFE have discs that are smoother and more rotationally symmetric, compared to those simulated with a constant SFE; galaxies simulated with early stellar feedback have more regular discs than supernova-feedback-only galaxies. We find that the rotational asymmetry of the HI discs depends most strongly on the underlying physics model, making this a promising observable for understanding the physics responsible for shaping the interstellar medium of galaxies.</p>

<p>We measure empirical relationships between the local star formation rate (SFR) and properties of the star-forming molecular gas on 1.5 kpc scales across 80 nearby galaxies. These relationships, commonly referred to as “star formation laws,” aim at predicting the local SFR surface density from various combinations of molecular gas surface density, galactic orbital time, molecular cloud free fall time, and the interstellar medium dynamical equilibrium pressure. Leveraging a multiwavelength database built for the Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby Galaxies (PHANGS) survey, we measure these quantities consistently across all galaxies and quantify systematic uncertainties stemming from choices of SFR calibrations and the CO-to-H2 conversion factors. The star formation laws we examine show 0.3-0.4 dex of intrinsic scatter, among which the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation shows a ~10% larger scatter than the other three. The slope of this relation ranges β ≈ 0.9-1.2, implying that the molecular gas depletion time remains roughly constant across the environments probed in our sample. The other relations have shallower slopes (β ≈ 0.6-1.0), suggesting that the star formation efficiency per orbital time, the star formation efficiency per free fall time, and the pressure-to-SFR surface density ratio (i.e., the feedback yield) vary systematically with local molecular gas and SFR surface densities. Last but not least, the shapes of the star formation laws depend sensitively on methodological choices. Different choices of SFR calibrations can introduce systematic uncertainties of at least 10%-15% in the star formation law slopes and 0.15-0.25 dex in their normalization, while the CO-to-H2 conversion factors can additionally produce uncertainties of 20%-25% for the slope and 0.10-0.20 dex for the normalization.</p>

<h2 id="variationspaper">  Variations in the Σ<sub>SFR</sub> − Σ<sub>mol</sub> − Σ<sub>∗</sub> plane across galactic environments in PHANGS galaxies  </h2>

<p>Aims: There exists some consensus that the stellar mass surface density (Σ<sub>∗</sub>) and molecular gas mass surface density (Σ<sub>mol</sub>) are the main quantities responsible for locally setting the star formation rate. This regulation is inferred from locally resolved scaling relations between these two quantities and the star formation rate surface density (Σ<sub>SFR</sub>), which have been extensively studied in a wide variety of works. However, the universality of these relations is debated. Here, we probe the interplay between these three quantities across different galactic environments at a spatial resolution of 150 pc.
Methods: We performed a hierarchical Bayesian linear regression to find the best set of parameters C<sub>∗</sub>, C<sub>mol</sub>, and C<sub>norm</sub> that describe the star-forming plane conformed by Σ<sub>∗</sub>, Σ<sub>mol</sub>, and Σ<sub>SFR</sub>, such that logΣ<sub>SFR</sub> = C<sub>∗</sub>logΣ<sub>∗</sub> + C<sub>mol</sub>logΣ<sub>mol</sub> + C<sub>norm</sub>. We also explored variations in the determined parameters across galactic environments, focusing our analysis on the C<sub>∗</sub> and C<sub>mol</sub> slopes.
Results: We find signs of variations in the posterior distributions of C<sub>∗</sub> and C<sub>mol</sub> across different galactic environments. The dependence of Σ<sub>SFR</sub> on Σ<sub>∗</sub> spans a wide range of slopes, with negative and positive values, while the dependence of Σ<sub>SFR</sub> on Σ<sub>mol</sub> is always positive. Bars show the most negative value of C<sub>∗</sub> (−0.41), which is a sign of longer depletion times, while spiral arms show the highest C<sub>∗</sub> among all environments (0.45). Variations in C<sub>mol</sub> also exist, although they are more subtle than those found for C<sub>∗</sub>.
Conclusions: We conclude that systematic variations in the interplay of Σ<sub>∗</sub>, Σ<sub>mol</sub>, and Σ<sub>SFR</sub> across different galactic environments exist at a spatial resolution of 150 pc, and we interpret these variations to be produced by an additional mechanism regulating the formation of stars that is not captured by either Σ<sub>∗</sub> or Σ<sub>mol</sub>. Studying environmental variations in single galaxies, we find that these variations correlate with changes in the star formation efficiency across environments, which could be linked to the dynamical state of the gas that prevents it from collapsing and forming stars, or to changes in the molecular gas fraction.</p>

<p>Accurately reproducing the thin cold gas discs observed in nearby spiral galaxies has been a long standing issue in cosmological simulations. Here, we present measurements of the radially resolved HI scale height in 22 non-interacting Milky Way-mass galaxies from the FIREbox cosmological volume. We measure the HI scale heights using five different approaches commonly used in the literature: fitting the vertical volume density distribution with a Gaussian, the distance between maximum and half-maximum of the vertical volume density distribution, a semi-empirical description using the velocity dispersion and the galactic gravitational potential, the analytic assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, and the distance from the midplane which encloses ≳60 per cent of the HI mass. We find median HI scale heights, measured using the vertical volume distribution, that range from ~100 pc in the galactic centres to ~800 pc in the outskirts and are in excellent agreement with recent observational results. We speculate that the presence of a realistic multiphase interstellar medium, including cold gas, and realistic stellar feedback are the drivers behind the realistic HI scale heights.</p>

<p>The formation and evolution of stellar clusters is intimately linked to that of their host galaxies. To study this connection, we present the EMP-Pathfindersuite of cosmological zoom-in Milky Way-mass simulations. These simulations contain a subgrid description for stellar cluster formation and evolution, allowing us to study the simultaneous formation and evolution of stellar clusters alongside their host galaxies across cosmic time. As a key ingredient in these simulations, we include the physics of the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium (ISM), which enables studies of how the presence of a cold, dense ISM affects star cluster formation and evolution. We consider two different star formation prescriptions: a constant star formation efficiency per free-fall time, as well as an environmentally dependent, turbulence-based prescription. We identify two key results drawn from these simulations. First, we find that the tidal shock-driven disruption caused by the graininess of the cold ISM produces old (τ&gt;10 Gyr) stellar cluster populations with properties that are in excellent agreement with the observed populations in the Milky Way and M31. Importantly, the addition of the cold ISM addresses the areas of disagreement found in previous simulations that lacked the cold gas phase. Secondly, we find that the formation of stellar clusters is extremely sensitive to the baryonic physics that govern the properties of the cold, dense gas reservoir in the galaxy. This implies that the demographics of the stellar cluster population represent an important diagnostic tool for constraining baryonic physics models in upcoming galaxy formation simulations that also include a description of the cold ISM.</p>

<p>We use high-resolution maps of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) in the centres of
eighty-six nearby galaxies from the millimetre-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object
Masses (WISDOM) and Physics at High Angular Resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS)
surveys to investigate the physical mechanisms setting the morphology of the ISM at molecular
cloud scales. We show that early-type galaxies tend to have smooth, regular molecular gas
morphologies, while the ISM in spiral galaxy bulges is much more asymmetric and clumpy
when observed at the same spatial scales. We quantify these differences using non-parametric
morphology measures (Asymmetry, Smoothness and Gini), and compare these measurements
with those extracted from idealised galaxy simulations. We show that the morphology of the
molecular ISM changes systematically as a function of various large scale galaxy parameters,
including galaxy morphological type, stellar mass, stellar velocity dispersion, effective stellar
mass surface density, molecular gas surface density, star formation efficiency and the presence
of a bar. We perform a statistical analysis to determine which of these correlated parameters
best predicts the morphology of the ISM. We find the effective stellar mass surface (or
volume) density to be the strongest predictor of the morphology of the molecular gas, while
star formation and bars maybe be important secondary drivers. We find that gas self-gravity
is not the dominant process shaping the morphology of the molecular gas in galaxy centres.
Instead effects caused by the depth of the potential well such as shear, suppression of stellar
spiral density waves and/or inflow affect the ability of the gas to fragment.</p>
